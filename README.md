# Finance Performance & Cashflow Analysis Dashboard 

### Executive Summary:

<p align ="justify"> Using SQL, Python, and Power BI, I analyzed customer finance performance data and built a dashboard to evaluate income patterns, spending behavior, savings growth, and overall cashflow stability across the client base. After identifying that the strongest opportunities for financial improvement come from optimizing expense distribution, stabilizing monthly cashflow, and increasing contributions toward long-term financial goals, I recommend that financial teams implement several strategic adjustments to support stronger customer outcomes:</p>

- Enhance customer budgeting strategies by guiding them to reduce high-impact discretionary expenses

- Promote savings programs and automated contributions to improve long-term goal completion rates

- Develop targeted financial recommendations for customers with irregular cashflow or declining savings balances

### Business Problem:

<p align="justify"> Customer financial performance is impacted by fluctuating income, rising expenses, and insufficient contribution toward key goals. According to the dashboard the user generated $85,174 in total income, spent $62,590, and saved $20,319, all showing YoY declines, indicating deteriorating financial health Personal Finance Tracker. The cashflow chart reveals inconsistent income patterns (Nov ’24 – Sep ’25), while the expense breakdown shows that Investment (46%), Housing & Utilities (27%), and Healthcare (13%) account for the largest spend categories. These imbalances reduce financial flexibility and slow progress toward savings milestones, with only 49% of the Retirement Fund and 25% of the Emergency Fund completed so far.

A systematic financial analysis is required to identify which spending behaviors, budget decisions, or income patterns are limiting long-term financial growth. </p>

### Methodology: 

- Data Extraction: SQL queries to pull income, expenses, savings, transactions, and category-level data.
- Data Processing: Python (Pandas, Numpy) for cleaning, transformations, trend analysis, anomaly detection.
- Visualization: Power BI dashboard with cashflow trends, category breakdown, YoY variances, and goal progress.
- Comparative Analysis: Month-over-month cashflow, annual financial shifts, category impact assessment, and savings rate evaluation.

### Skills:

- SQL: Data filtering, aggregations, financial summaries.

- Python: Cleaning, time-series analysis, category modeling.

- Power BI: DAX, dynamic visuals, financial KPI dashboards.

- Financial Analytics: Cashflow modeling, expense forecasting, savings evaluation.

- BI Storytelling: Insight communication, goal tracking, user behavior analysis.

### Results & Business Recommendations:

<p align="justify"> 
The dashboard reveals declining income (-8.5% YoY) and expenses down (-14.7%), but savings remain insufficient to meet long-term goals. Cashflow volatility across the year indicates inconsistent budgeting. Investment and Housing & Utilities represent 73% of total expenses, limiting liquidity. Increasing monthly savings by just 5% could significantly accelerate progress on the Home Down Payment and Emergency Fund goals. Optimizing spending distribution is essential to improve financial stability and long-term growth. </p>

<p align="justify"> 
Because the strongest financial opportunities come from improving savings consistency, reducing high-impact expenses, and stabilizing income-to-expense ratios, I recommend:

Reallocate 5–10% of monthly expenses from discretionary categories to savings goals.

Automate contributions to the Emergency Fund and Retirement accounts to reach targets faster.

Reduce Investment category spend temporarily to stabilize cashflow and increase liquidity.

Implement monthly spending caps for Food, Transport, and Utilities categories.

Leverage surplus months (Jan, May, Sep) to increase principal contributions toward long-term goals.</p>

### Next Steps:

📌 Build a 12-month predictive model for income and expenses.
📌 Add forecasting for savings goal completion (Retirement, Home, Emergency).
📌 Automate alerts when spending exceeds category limits.
📌 Integrate multi-year financial projections into the dashboard.
📌 Present insights in a finance review report for long-term planning.
